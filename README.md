# Java-Last4EvenSum-Array
This Java program calculates the sum of the last four even numbers from a user-input array. It reads an array size, takes integer inputs, and iterates backward to find and sum the last four even numbers. If fewer than four even numbers exist, it sums all available ones. Ideal for learning array traversal, conditional logic, and summation in Java.
